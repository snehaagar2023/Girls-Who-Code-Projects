    <h2> “Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world." - UN Global Compact</h2>

    <p style="padding-top: 70px" >Over the last few decades there has been progress in the fight to achieve gender inequality: more girls are going to school, fewer girls are forced into early marriage, laws are being reformed, and more women are serving in leadership positions. 
</p>
    <p>However, many challenges still remain as women continue to be underrepresented in many fields including politics, science, and tech, face discriminatory laws, and experience high rates of physical or sexual violence. 
</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 70px" >Especially in low-income communities, women have even fewer opportunities and less power to improve their lives due to restrictive policies that limit their participation in the economy and earring power. Harmful social norms deny them control over their own lives, education, health, employment, and marital and reproductive choices.
