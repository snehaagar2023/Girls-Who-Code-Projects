    <p> My name is Sneha  and I'm a rising senior in highschool. I've been coding since I was in 7th grade and was first introduced to it by the Girls Who Code Club at my school. Since then I've continued my journey with coding and explored different projects including web development, making cool games, and conducting research using Data Science. I enjoy looking for new problem statments to takle and I'm passionate about inspiring others to pursue their own interests in STEM. Along with coding my hobbies include: dancing, listening to music, riding my bike, and painting!</p>
